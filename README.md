## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a single responsive web page with a header and three sections. The page adjusts its layout based on the width of the browser window, using CSS media queries to provide different views for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout changes based on the screen width:
  - **Desktop View (992px and above)**: The three sections are displayed in a single row.
  - **Tablet View (768px to 991px)**: Two sections are displayed in the first row, and the third section is displayed in the second row.
  - **Mobile View (767px and below)**: Each section takes up the full width of the screen.
- **Section Titles**: Each section has a title that is positioned at the top right corner and styled to stand out.
- **Visual Enhancements**: The sections are styled with padding, background colors, borders, and shadows to improve the visual appeal.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `css/styles.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the web page.
